# Ember-demo

## ASH Documentation
This assumes you've gone through ASH's Ember setup documentation. If you have not or need this information, contact the Front End Team.

To get started, clone this repo locally and `ember init`. Each branch will take you through subsequent steps.

## Shorthand
`ember g` = `ember generate`
`ember s` = `ember serve`

## Instructions (Complete step 2+ before moving on to the `step2` branch)
1. Open `package.json` and remove the ember welcome package (this step is already done in this branch)
1. `ember g template application` to create a template for your entire app's layout
1. `ember g route index products products/edit`
1. Add headings to each route's templates
1. In application.hbs, add `link-to` helpers for the index and product routes
